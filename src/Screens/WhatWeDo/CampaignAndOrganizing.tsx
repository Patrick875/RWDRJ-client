								16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence Campaign
							</p>
							<p className="p-3 text-white">
								Each year, from 25 November to 10 December, World Human Rights
								Day, the 16 Days of Activism campaign calls for action against
								one of the world ’s most persistent violations of human rights –
								violence against women.

							<p className="p-3 text-white">
								In June 1991, the Centre for Women’s Global Leadership (CWGL),
								alongside participants of the first Women’s Global Institute on
								Women, Violence and Human Rights, called for a global campaign
								of 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence.

								the 16days of Activism against Violence under the theme.

								Rwanda Women Doctors For Reproductive Justice (RWDFRJ) took a
								significant stride in the global fight against gender based
								violence (GBV) by spearheading a campaign during the annual 16
								Days of Activism. This international initiative, spanning from
								25th November to 10th December, seeks to address one of the
								world's most persistent violations of human rights violence
								against women. RWDFRJ campaign aligns with the overarching goal
								of the 16 Days, underscoring the imperative need for global
								action against this pervasive issue. Commencing on the
								International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women
								on 25th November, RWDFRJ campaign unfolded over 16 days,
								concluding on International Human Rights Day on 10th December.
								This strategic timeline not only emphasizes the gravity of the
								issue but also highlights the interconnectedness between
								violence against women and the broader spectrum of human rights.

								RWDFRJ campaign during the 16 Days of Activism against Gender
								Based Violence serves as a commendable example of proactive
								engagement in the global fight for women's rights. By addressing
								the interconnected issues of reproductive justice and violence
								against women, RWDFRJ exemplifies the potential impact of
								combining medical expertise with advocacy. As we reflect on the
								significance of these 16 days, RWDFRJ commitment inspires us to
								continue the collective journey towards a world where women can
								live free from the pervasive threat of gender based violence.
