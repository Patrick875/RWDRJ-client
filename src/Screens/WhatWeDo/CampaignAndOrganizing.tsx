										Women are at risk of losing lifetime opportunities because

										facing unjust imprisonments, losing their freedom from
										having unsafe abortions. Additionally, young girls who get
										unintended pregnancies face school dropouts, family
										discrimination, and harassment, leading to life-long poverty
										for themselves and their future families. With these values,
										Our campaigns empower women step-by-step with autonomy to
										control their bodies, and decide for themselves if, when,
										how, and with whom they can give birth, and we believe that
										this autonomy allows women to control their lives, plan for
										their future and access as equal opportunities as other
										genders.

// 								violence against women.
// 							</p>
// 							<p className="p-3 text-white">
// 								In June 1991, the Centre for Women’s Global Leadership (CWGL),
// 								alongside participants of the first Women’s Global Institute on
// 								Women, Violence and Human Rights, called for a global campaign
// 								of 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence.

// 								Rwanda Women Doctors For Reproductive Justice (RWDFRJ) took a
// 								significant stride in the global fight against gender based
// 								violence (GBV) by spearheading a campaign during the annual 16
// 								Days of Activism. This international initiative, spanning from
// 								25th November to 10th December, seeks to address one of the
// 								world's most persistent violations of human rights violence
// 								against women. RWDFRJ campaign aligns with the overarching goal
// 								of the 16 Days, underscoring the imperative need for global
// 								action against this pervasive issue. Commencing on the
// 								International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women
// 								on 25th November, RWDFRJ campaign unfolded over 16 days,
// 								concluding on International Human Rights Day on 10th December.
// 								This strategic timeline not only emphasizes the gravity of the
// 								issue but also highlights the interconnectedness between
// 								violence against women and the broader spectrum of human rights.

// 							<p className="p-3 text-white">
// 								RWDFRJ campaign during the 16 Days of Activism against Gender
// 								Based Violence serves as a commendable example of proactive
// 								engagement in the global fight for women's rights. By addressing
// 								the interconnected issues of reproductive justice and violence
// 								against women, RWDFRJ exemplifies the potential impact of
// 								combining medical expertise with advocacy. As we reflect on the
// 								significance of these 16 days, RWDFRJ commitment inspires us to
// 								continue the collective journey towards a world where women can
// 								live free from the pervasive threat of gender based violence.
