								Feminism is at the heart of our radical approach. Doctors are
								the most influencing individuals when it comes to abortion.
								Additionally, women are the most well positioned to speak out
								against the injustice they face.Rwanda Women Doctors For
								Reproductive Justice was initiated in 2021 by young feminists to
								create a network of pro-choice women physicians who are
								progressive enough to provide legal, safe abortion services. The
								aim was to unite and empower women to support women.
							</p>
							<p className="py-3 ">
								Our approach is unique and inspiring. Through creativity,
								organizing, and a sense of solidarity, we created a movement of
								resistance to inequity spearheaded by feminists.
							</p>
							<p className="py-3 ">
								We know well that not everyone is ready to taste changes brought
								by the feminist movements. Many are afraid to face women who
								exercise their full rights to decide about their bodies. Many
								groups are unwilling to openly and comprehensively address
								abortion rights and legal access issues. This is because, in
								reality, the power to decide is embedded in a patriarchal
								system, and women continue to suffer from limited access to
								legal services. At RWDFRJ, we believe there is a need to shift
								the power to the most vulnerable and most affected. We
								prioritize collaborative care and protect our members from
								external threats and harassment.
