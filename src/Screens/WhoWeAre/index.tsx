						We are a network of young women physicians in Rwanda. We share the
						spirit of activism driven by the passion for radically advancing
						women's access to sexual and reproductive rights
					</p>
					<p className="py-3 text-xs">
						Feminism is at the heart of our radical approach. Doctors are the
						most influencing individuals when it comes to abortion.
						Additionally, women are the most well positioned to speak out
						against the injustice they face.Rwanda Women Doctors For
						Reproductive Justice was initiated in 2021 by young feminists to
						create a network of pro-choice women physicians who are progressive
						enough to provide legal, safe abortion services. The aim was to
						unite and empower women to support women.
					</p>
					<p className="py-3 text-xs">
						Our approach is unique and inspiring. Through creativity,
						organizing, and a sense of solidarity, we created a movement of
						resistance to inequity spearheaded by feminists.
					</p>
					<p className="py-3 text-xs">
						We know well that not everyone is ready to taste changes brought by
						the feminist movements. Many are afraid to face women who exercise
						their full rights to decide about their bodies. Many groups are
						unwilling to openly and comprehensively address abortion rights and
						legal access issues. This is because, in reality, the power to
						decide is embedded in a patriarchal system, and women continue to
						suffer from limited access to legal services. At RWDFRJ, we believe
						there is a need to shift the power to the most vulnerable and most
						affected. We prioritize collaborative care and protect our members
						from external threats and harassment.
